# BibTeX-XML

This project started as an exam project of my studies in the subject
"Dokumentbeschreibungssprachen" (en. _markup languages_). The task was to
develop an XML language for describing BibTeX databases, convert a given large
database into that language and display it via a webbrowser using CSS and/or
XSL Transformations.

Now, after the project has been submitted, some parts of it are serving me for
my own software development training. The original database from the exam task
has been left in the repository for being used as test data, but the original
repository structure may have changed when you're reading this because there are
no requirements to build a submission folder anymore.

Because this is only for my own training, this repository will implement things
others may have done before (e.g. there is a bibtex package available for
Haskell which is most likely much futher developed than my version).
